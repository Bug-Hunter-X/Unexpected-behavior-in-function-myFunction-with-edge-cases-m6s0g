# MATLAB Unhandled Exception Bug Report

This repository contains a MATLAB function, `myFunction.m`, that demonstrates unexpected behavior when dealing with edge cases.  The function exhibits undefined behavior for certain inputs (e.g., non-numeric, complex, or values outside expected range). 

The `bugSolution.m` file provides a corrected version of the function that addresses these issues.

## Bug Description:
The original `myFunction.m` function does not handle cases where the input `x` is not a positive real number within a defined range efficiently. This leads to errors or unexpected outputs.

## Solution:
The solution implements robust input validation and provides clear error messages or handles unexpected inputs gracefully.
